# Simulate data and fit 2-species occupancy model à la Rota et al. (2016) w/ Jags and Nimble

We consider a two-species static occupancy model à la [Rota et al. (2016)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12587). We simulate data from this model, and fit the model to these data using `Jags` and `Nimble`.
The equations below do no display well, you'd rather have a look to the [PDF file](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/bayes2speciesoccupancy/blob/master/simul_rota.pdf). With the [Rmd file](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/bayes2speciesoccupancy/blob/master/simul_rota.Rmd), you can run the code in RStudio and reproduce the results.
